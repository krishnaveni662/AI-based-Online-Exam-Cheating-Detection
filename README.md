AI-Based Online Exam Cheating Detection System
🎯 Overview
This project is an AI-powered proctoring system designed to ensure integrity in online examinations by detecting cheating behavior in real time.
The system uses computer vision and deep learning to monitor students through their webcam and automatically flag suspicious activities such as multiple faces, gaze deviation, or use of unauthorized devices.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-Time Monitoring – Continuously tracks the candidate through the webcam during the exam.
✅ Face Detection & Recognition – Identifies and verifies the candidate’s presence.
✅ Multiple Face Detection – Flags additional faces appearing in the frame.
✅ Gaze & Head Pose Tracking – Detects if the candidate is looking away from the screen frequently.
✅ Object Detection – Recognizes unauthorized objects (e.g., mobile phones, books).
✅ Voice Activity Detection – Detects speech or background voices that indicate possible cheating.
✅ Flask Web Interface – Provides an easy-to-use browser interface for real-time monitoring.
✅ Alert System – Generates automatic alerts and logs all suspicious events.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-cheating-detection.git
cd ai-cheating-detection

2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
source venv/bin/activate   # For Mac/Linux

3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run the Application
python app.py

5️⃣ Access the Web App
Open your browser and go to:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000

🧠 How It Works
Webcam Feed – The webcam captures live video of the candidate.
Face & Gaze Detection – AI models track the user’s face and monitor gaze direction.
Object & Voice Detection – Detects if mobile devices, books, or background conversations occur.
Alert System – Logs any suspicious activity and optionally sends alerts to administrators.
